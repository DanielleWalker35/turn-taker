A full-stack web application that helps families, friends, or co-workers assign chores or activities in a fair way. 
- Assignments are base on an ability/age level and how many chores/activities someone has already been assigned. 
- You can add, edit and delete people and chores then easily assign chores.

The logic behind assiging chores taking into consideration the age level and who has already been assigned. Gained a good understanding of how to pass state data to different componenets.

### Future Development
